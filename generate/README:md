# Assembly Vision

Assembly Vision is a project for generating synthetic datasets for object detection and pose estimation in large-scale robotic assembly tasks. The project uses Blender and Python to create images with various objects, textures, and backgrounds. It generates labels for detection and pose estimation tasks and can be used to train machine learning models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Blender 2.93 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/assembly_vision.git
```

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd assembly_vision
```

3. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux or macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Configure the `config.yaml` file to set the model paths, output directories, background and texture paths, and other parameters.

2. Run the `generate_dataset.py` script:
```bash
python generate_dataset.py
```


This will generate the synthetic dataset with images, labels, and other metadata.
